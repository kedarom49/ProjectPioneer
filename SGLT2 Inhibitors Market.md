Serious but rare side effects include ketoacidosis and kidney damage.</p> <p><strong>Which SGLT2 inhibitors are most commonly prescribed?</strong><br> Some of the most prescribed SGLT2 inhibitors include Empagliflozin (Jardiance), Dapagliflozin (Farxiga), and Canagliflozin (Invokana).</p> <p><strong>Are SGLT2 inhibitors safe for long-term use?</strong><br> SGLT2 inhibitors are generally considered safe for long-term use, but patients should be monitored for potential side effects such as kidney issues or infections.</p> <p><strong>How do SGLT2 inhibitors help with heart failure?</strong><br> SGLT2 inhibitors help reduce the risk of hospitalization due to heart failure and improve heart function by lowering fluid retention and reducing the strain on the heart.</p> <p><strong>Can SGLT2 inhibitors be used for type 1 diabetes?</strong><br> SGLT2 inhibitors are not approved for type 1 diabetes treatment due to the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis. They are specifically designed for type 2 diabetes.</p> <p><strong>What is the market value of SGLT2 inhibitors?</strong><br> The global market for SGLT2 inhibitors was valued at USD 7.3 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach USD 18.2 billion by 2030.</p> <p><strong>Which regions have the highest demand for SGLT2 inhibitors?</strong><br> North America and Europe are the leading regions in the demand for SGLT2 inhibitors, followed by the rapidly growing Asia Pacific market.</p> </p><p><strong>Top Global SGLT2 Inhibitors Market Companies</strong></p><div data-test-id=""><p><li>AstraZeneca</li><li> Hengrui Medicine</li><li> Johnson and Johnson</li><li> Kelun Pharmaceutical</li><li> Chia Tai-Tianqing Pharmaceutical</li><li> Hansoh Pharmaceutical Group</li><li> Orifarm</li><li> Starpharma</li><li> Sandoz</li><li> Bristol-Myers Squibb</li><li> Boehringer Ingelheim</li><li> Merck</li></p><div><strong>Regional Analysis of&nbsp;Global SGLT2 Inhibitors Market</strong></div><ul><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">North America&nbsp;(Global, Canada, and Mexico, etc.)</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">Europe (Global, Germany, and France, etc.)</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">Asia Pacific&nbsp;(Global, China, and Japan, etc.)</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">Latin America&nbsp;(Global, Brazil, and Argentina, etc.)</p></li><li dir="ltr">Middle East and Africa&nbsp;(Global, Saudi Arabia, and South Africa, etc.)</li></ul><p><strong>For More Information or Query, Visit @&nbsp;</strong><strong><a href="https://www.verifiedmarketreports.com/product/sglt2-inhibitors-market/?utm_source=Githubf&amp;utm_medium=204" target="_blank">Global SGLT2 Inhibitors Market Insights Size And Forecast</a></strong></p></div>
